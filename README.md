# YourFlix TV Show ReNamer

 Used to bat rename .mp4 files for use on YourFlix. Also my first attempt at making a WPF Windows Application

I want my Videos to have the same Fromating:

- The Video file names are just the Episode Sufflix and Title, i.e. E01 Help Wanted
- The Video Title give you the full video title, i.e. Spongebob Squarepants S01E01 Help Wanted

This is normally a laborious task but with this aplication it is very simple and infact I can do entire seasons in moments. 

What this application is for is to be able to Batch Rename a TV Series with out using the Windows UI. For instance lets say I am processing Spongbob Squarepant's first season. What this program will let me do is.

1) Set the Video Title for the TV Series, in this case it's 'Spongebob Squarepants'
2) Set the Season Suffix, in this case it's 'S01'
3) Select the folder where my videos are located
4) Rename the Files of each video, or add or change the Video Title, to add special characters like "/","\","?",etc.
5) Process the folder.
